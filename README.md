# ðŸ§  SRDDQN: Self-Rewarding Deep Q-Network for Stock Trading

This project implements a self-rewarding reinforcement learning system for financial trading using a **TimesNet-based Reward Network** and a **Self-Rewarding Double DQN (SRDDQN)** agent. It uses both **daily and weekly OHLCV data** and integrates expert-defined rewards like **Sharpe Ratio, Return, and Min-Max** to simulate realistic trading strategies.
